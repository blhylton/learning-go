# My Go Experiments

Recently, due to some feedback that I've received, I've taken on learning [GoLang](https://golang.org/). This is just a
repository for gathering all of my "Baby's First Project" projects since working through things like this is how I learn
best.

If you see anything you want to use, feel free to copy any of it. I don't expect any of this to be groundbreaking or
anything, and I can't guarantee that in some cases it will even be correct, so use at your own risk.

I also welcome any code review or pointers should someone feel inclined.
